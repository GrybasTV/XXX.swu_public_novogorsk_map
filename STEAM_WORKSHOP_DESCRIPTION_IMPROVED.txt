[h1]🔥 Warmachine: Ukraine vs Russia 2025 [COMMUNITY SCENARIO] 🔥[/h1]

This is a [b]heavily modified and adapted version[/b] of the original Warmachine Conquest mission.

This scenario is set in a fictionalized 2025 conflict and features custom factions, improved gameplay mechanics, and numerous bug fixes.

[h2]❗ IMPORTANT NOTE ❗[/h2]
"Make Arma Not War" – This mission is a realistic simulation and not a political statement.
